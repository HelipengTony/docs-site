# Introduction to Next.js Pages

In Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) exported from a .js, .jsx, .ts, or .tsx file in the pages directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

**Example**: If you create pages/about.js that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at /about.

```jsx
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
export default About
```

## Pages with Dynamic Routes

Next.js supports pages with dynamic routes. For example, if you create a file called pages/posts/[id].js, then it will be accessible at posts/1, posts/2, etc.

## Pre-rendering
By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called hydration.)
